My name is Kiarash Soleimanzadeh, a software engineer and an AI/ML enthusiast who values learning and growing with people, teams, and technologies. I have over 15 years of experience specializing in the software industry as a senior software engineer, software architect and consultant, backend developer, DevOps engineer, and frontend developer. I have a solid background in my journey in the world of technology.

I am a big supporter of open-source software. However, I have been involved with some closed-source projects on a stable software development methodology and technology for both large-scale and regular-size applications.

I am not only a highly self-motivated, self-taught, creative, hard-working, and problem-solver student but also a leader and senior software engineer. I am incredibly interested in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning. If I am not developing codes, I am somewhere else, thinking about Artificial Intelligence. Also, my free time is dedicated to hiking, camping, cycling, reading, swimming, and listening to music. These works are my daily schedules, so feel free to ask for anything related.
