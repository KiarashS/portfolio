 My name is Kiarash Soleimanzadeh, a researcher, software engineer, and a science enthusiast.

I am not only a highly self-motivated, self-taught, creative, hard-working, and problem-solver student but also a researcher, software engineer, and a science enthusiast.

If I am not developing codes, I am somewhere else, thinking about novel research ideas. Also, my free time is dedicated to hiking, camping, cooking, cycling, reading, swimming, and listening to music. These works are my daily schedules, so feel free to ask for anything related.

I am so interested in data science, big data, artificial intelligence in medicine, and natural language processing to improve quality of life.
