My name is Kiarash Soleimanzadeh, a teaching assistant, researcher, and software engineer who aims to evolve, innovate, and inspire through technology. I have over 16 years of experience specializing in the software industry as a software engineer, software architect and consultant, backend developer, DevOps engineer, and frontend developer. I have a solid background in my journey in the world of technology.

I have been involved with projects on a stable software development methodology and technology for both large-scale and regular-size applications.

I am not only a highly self-motivated, self-taught, creative, hard-working, and problem-solver student but also a teaching assistant, researcher, and software engineer. I am incredibly interested in applications of artificial intelligence in Medicine, Healthcare and Natural Language Processing. If I am not developing codes, I am somewhere else, thinking about novel research ideas. Also, my free time is dedicated to hiking, camping, cycling, reading, swimming, and listening to music. These works are my daily schedules, so feel free to ask for anything related.

I'm interested in AI in Medicine and Healthcare, Natural Language Processing, and Smart Health.
