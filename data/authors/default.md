 My name is Kiarash Soleimanzadeh, a teaching assistant, researcher, software engineer, and a smart-healthcare enthusiast.

I am not only a highly self-motivated, self-taught, creative, hard-working, and problem-solver student but also a teaching assistant, researcher, software engineer, and a smart-healthcare enthusiast.

If I am not developing codes, I am somewhere else, thinking about novel research ideas. Also, my free time is dedicated to hiking, camping, cooking, cycling, reading, swimming, and listening to music. These works are my daily schedules, so feel free to ask for anything related.

I am so interested in applications of computer engineering and computer science in healthcare (smart-healthcare) and natural language processing to improve quality of life.
