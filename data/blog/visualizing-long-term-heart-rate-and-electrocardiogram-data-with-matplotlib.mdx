# Introduction

Electrocardiogram (ECG) data—captured from wearable sensors—provides rich physiological insights. In this tutorial, we explore how to:

- Load ECG time-series data
- Preprocess and clean the signal
- Detect heartbeats (R‑peaks)
- Compute heart rate
- Visually analyze ECG traces in Python using `Matplotlib`
