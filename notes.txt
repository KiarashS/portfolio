“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” Martin Fowler said. Code is clean if it can be understood easily by everyone on the team. Clean code can be read and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. With understandability comes readability, changeability, extensibility, and maintainability. I've prepared a summary of the *Clean Code book by Robert Cecil Martin* for you, please check out [go.kiarashs.ir/cc](https://go.kiarashs.ir/cc "Clean Code").
